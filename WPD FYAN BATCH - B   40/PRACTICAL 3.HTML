The purpose of AIML is to simplify the task of dialog modeling and 
make it easier according to the stimulus-response approach.</b>
<i>Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines or software,
 as opposed to the intelligence of humans or animals.
 It is a field of study in computer science that 
develops and studies intelligent machines. Such machines may be called AI</i>
<u>Artificial intelligence is the science of making machines that can think like humans.
 It can do things that are considered "smart."
 AI technology can process large amounts of data in ways, unlike humans.
 The goal for AI is to be able to do things such as recognize patterns,
 make decisions, and judge like humans.</u>

 programmers typically use programming languages such as Python, R, or Java,
 as well as specialized libraries and frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn
What is AIML used for?
AIML can be used to create chatbots, and computer programs that mimic human conversation.
 AIML can also be used to create virtual assistants,
 which are computer programs that can perform tasks such as scheduling appointments and sending emails.
